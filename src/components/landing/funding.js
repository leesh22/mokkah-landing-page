        <p>We are raising £10,000 to kickstart our business.</p>
        <p>The funds will be used to launch The Noir Collection; five different styles, all in black to suit every occasion.</p>
        <p>No donation is too small and we’ll be sure to keep you updated along the journey.</p>
        <p>Together, we will change the industry, one shoe at a time.</p>
